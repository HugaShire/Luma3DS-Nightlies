# Luma3DS-Nightlies
This is for the nightlies of https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS. 

This is a backup of https://astronautlevel2.github.io/Luma3DS/ incase it is not working.

This repo will only upload the Boot.Firm (unless other files are required for fix).

This will not be updated fast, as this is not ran by bots. I will try to update every day.

THIS DOES NOT COME WITH WARRENTY. It should be safe although.
I am not responsible for any bricks, neither are anyone involved in Luma3DS themselves. 
YOU ARE RESPONSIBE FOR ALL ACTIONS YOU DO WITH THIS ON YOU SYSTEM
